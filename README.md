🧠 Data Marketplace

A decentralized Data Marketplace that enables secure, transparent, and fair exchange of data assets between providers and consumers using blockchain technology and smart contracts.

This platform empowers individuals and organizations to monetize their data without relying on centralized intermediaries — ensuring ownership, privacy, and transparency through cryptographic verification and decentralized storage.

🌍 Overview

In traditional data markets, users lose control of their data once shared. Centralized entities often collect, sell, and profit from user data without fair compensation or transparency.

The Data Marketplace solves this by creating a Web3-powered ecosystem where:

Data providers can list their datasets for sale.

Data consumers can buy access using cryptocurrency.

Smart contracts ensure fair payment, data access control, and proof of ownership.

🧩 Features

🔒 Decentralized Data Ownership — Data providers retain full control

💰 Fair Payments — Instant and automatic transfer of tokens upon purchase

📂 IPFS Integration — Decentralized data storage and retrieval

🔐 Access Control — Smart contract verifies buyer before giving data access

📊 Transparent Transactions — All operations are verifiable on-chain

🧠 Scalable Architecture — Can support multiple data categories (financial, healthcare, AI datasets, etc.)

📜 Example Smart Contract (Simplified)
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract DataMarketplace {
    struct DataItem {
        address provider;
        string dataHash;
        uint256 price;
        bool sold;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => DataItem) public dataItems;
    uint256 public itemCount;

    function listData(string memory _dataHash, uint256 _price) public {
        itemCount++;
        dataItems[itemCount] = DataItem(msg.sender, _dataHash, _price, false);
    }

    function buyData(uint256 _id) public payable {
        DataItem storage item = dataItems[_id];
        require(!item.sold, "Already sold");
        require(msg.value == item.price, "Incorrect payment");

        item.sold = true;
        payable(item.provider).transfer(msg.value);
    }

    function getData(uint256 _id) public view returns (string memory) {
        DataItem memory item = dataItems[_id];
        require(item.sold, "Data not purchased yet");
        return item.dataHash; // IPFS CID or encrypted data reference
    }
}
